# üö® A Framework for LLM-Assisted Smart Policing System

This project aims to modernize and enhance policing systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning. It leverages AI to assist in crime prediction, categorization, and communication‚Äîsupporting police departments in decision-making and intelligence.


üìå Description

"A Framework for LLM-Assisted Smart Policing System" is a full-stack machine learning application that uses GPT-3, XLNet, and traditional ML models to:

- Predict the type of crime based on textual description
- Classify incident reports using trained models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, BERT)
- Extract NLP features using LLMs (GPT, XLNet)
- Provide an admin dashboard for managing police station data and predicting crime categories

The system empowers local police with analytical tools to aid investigation and planning.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project
üñ•Ô∏è 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AJAY29082004/A-Framework-for-LLM-Assisted-Smart-Policing-System.git
cd A-Framework-for-LLM-Assisted-Smart-Policing-System
2. Set up Environment (Recommended: Anaconda)
conda create -n smartpolice python=3.10 -y
conda activate smartpolice
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt isn't included, manually install Flask, scikit-learn, joblib, mysql-connector-python, etc.
üß† 3. Start the Application

cd "FRONT END"
python app.py
Visit: http://localhost:5000 in your browser

‚ö†Ô∏è MySQL should be running locally with the correct DB structure and credentials in app.py
